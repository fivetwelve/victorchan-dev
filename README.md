  Source code for Victor Chan's website
</h1>

## ðŸš€ Quick facts

1.  **Built using Gatsby and Tailwind CSS**

    ```shell
    # website started with a minimal Gatsby framework
    npm init gatsby
    ```

2.  **Layout and formatting uses a mix of Tailwind and SCSS**
- The site is meant to be small and fairly lean.
- Lightbox uses `simple-react-lightbox`

3.  **This project uses `yarn` as its script runner.**

4.  **My code is free to re-use but the graphics are not.**
- Screenshots and masthead logo are &copy; 2022 Victor Chan (that's me).
- Logos are trademarked or registered by their respective companies.
- Icons are from https://fontawesome.com and, in my case, are from their Pro plan. There are plenty of free icons there, however.
- Remaining graphics in the site are used under license and not transferable.
